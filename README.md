# mater-goatcheese
A tamagotchi game created for a class project. The player takes care of lego bricks. A year passes every 15 seconds and the player can interact with 3 buttons which affect the hunger, heat, and boredom stats. The game ends when a stat reaches 10 or when the brick evolves into a unicorn piece at 10 years of age.

The lego images were taken from LEGO.com and bricklink.com. The background image is "Bliss" (1996) by Charles O'Rear. The image for the hand was taken from nicepng.com.
